Getting started
===============

There are many considerations when embarking upon a population genomic study. 

* What are your research questions?
* Is there a reference genome for your species of interest?
* Is there an annotated gene set?
* How many individuals do you want to sample?
* What kind of quality of DNA/RNA can you obtain?
* What is your research budget?

Genome assembly
===============

If you have the ability to obtain high-molecular weight DNA from a single individual of your study species, a cost-effective method for genome sequencing and assembly is a 10x linked-read

Getting started
===============

There are many considerations when embarking upon a population genomic study. 

* What are your research questions?
* Is there a reference genome for your species of interest?
* Is there an annotated gene set?
* How many individuals do you want to sample?
* What kind of quality of DNA/RNA can you obtain?
* What is your research budget?
